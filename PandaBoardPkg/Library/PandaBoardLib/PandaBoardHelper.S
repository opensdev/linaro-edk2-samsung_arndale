  Called at the early stage of the Boot phase to know if the memory has already been initialized

  Running the code from the reset vector does not mean we start from cold boot. In some case, we
  can go through this code with the memory already initialized.
  Because this function is called at the early stage, the implementation must not use the stack.
  Its implementation must probably done in assembly to ensure this requirement.

  @return   Return a non zero value if initialized

  Initialize the memory where the initial stacks will reside

  This memory can contain the initial stacks (Secure and Secure Monitor stacks).
  In some platform, this region is already initialized and the implementation of this function can
  do nothing. This memory can also represent the Secure RAM.
  This function is called before the satck has been set up. Its implementation must ensure the stack
  pointer is not used (probably required to use assembly language)
